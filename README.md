<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px;">Hi, I am Ayşegül. I am an undergraduate student at Middle East Technical University in Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department. I am an undergraduate researcher at [CEMMETU](http://cem.eee.metu.edu.tr/). You can download my CV [here](/docs/cv.pdf)</span>

## <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 24px;">Research Experiences & Internships</span>
* <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px;">CEMMETU, Undergraduate Researcher</span>
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px;">Currently working on a project which implements the basic idea of Electromagnetic Theory to build a high efficiency Wide-band Horn Antenna.</span>
* <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px;">IRIS TELECOMMUNICATION-NOKIA, Intern</span>
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px;">Fiber Optic Infrastructure Web Mapping Application</span>

## <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 24px;">Projects</span>
* <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px;">Design Of An Optical Wıreless Communicatıon System: Photo-Phone</span>
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px;">In this project, I designed wireless communication system which use visible light to transmit sound signals. The project is inspired from Bell’s first wireless telephone system.</span>
* <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px;">One Axis Helicopter</span>
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px;">I am implementing possible control approaches for a one axis “helicopter” by using a simple Arduino microcontroller, a motor driver circuit as well as a simple output measurement circuitry.</span>
* <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px;">Wireless Fire Detectıon System</span>
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px;">I designed fire detec on system which based on temperature of ambient. The sensing unit and communica on unit consists of temperature sensor, wireless communica on respectively. Different logic gates used for decision unit.</span>
* <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px;">Solar Tracking System</span>
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px;">I designed a single-axis solar tracking system. The actuator of the system is servo motor. Light sensors used for sensing. Depending on the light flux density, the servo motor actuate the panels in order to maximize the energy production.</span>

## <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 24px;">Programs</span>
* <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px;">Work and Travel, Jun 2016 – Sep 2016 | New Jersey, NJ</span>
* <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px;">MCNA Network, IoT, Feb 2018 – Jan 2018 | Ankara, TR</span>

## <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 24px;">Voluntariness</span>
* <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px;">TEGV, Educational Volunteer</span>
