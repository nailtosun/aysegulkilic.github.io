## Personal Webpage
Hi, I am Ayşegül. I am an undergraduate student at Middle East Technical University in Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department. I am an undergraduate researcher at [CEMMETU](http://cem.eee.metu.edu.tr/). You can download my CV [here](/docs/cv.pdf)

## Research Experiences & Internships
* CEMMETU, Undergraduate Researcher
Currently working on a project which implements the basic idea of Electromagnetic Theory to build a high efficiency Wide-band Horn Antenna.
* IRIS TELECOMMUNICATION-NOKIA, Intern
Fiber Optic Infrastructure Web Mapping Application

## Projects
* Design Of An Optical Wıreless Communicatıon System: Photo-Phone
In this project, I designed wireless communication system which use visible light to transmit sound signals. The project is inspired from Bell’s first wireless telephone system.
* One Axis Helicopter
I am implementing possible control approaches for a one axis “helicopter” by using a simple Arduino microcontroller, a motor driver circuit as well as a simple output measurement circuitry.
* Wireless Fire Detectıon System
I designed fire detec on system which based on temperature of ambient. The sensing unit and communica on unit consists of temperature sensor, wireless communica on respectively. Different logic gates used for decision unit.
* Solar Tracking System
I designed a single-axis solar tracking system. The actuator of the system is servo motor. Light sensors used for sensing. Depending on the light flux density, the servo motor actuate the panels in order to maximize the energy production.

## Programs
* Work and Travel, Jun 2016 – Sep 2016 | New Jersey, NJ
* MCNA Network, IoT, Feb 2018 – Jan 2018 | Ankara, TR

## Voluntariness
* TEGV, Educational Volunteer
The objective of TEGV is to provide educational programs and activities to help our elementary education level children become citizens who are loyal to the basic tenets of our republic, who are rational, prudent, self-confident, creative, pacifist, respecful of different beliefs and thoughts, and who do not discriminate based on gender, na onality, religion or language.
* LODOS, Volunteer
LODOS is a student community established in METU Cultural Affairs with the aim of providing socially complementary activities for our children with leukemia and mentally disabled individuals
